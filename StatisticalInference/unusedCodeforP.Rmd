## Sampling Distribution variance

The distribution of variances for the 1000 exponential samples ($n=40$, $\lambda=0.2$), will behave much like the distribution of means.  The variances will be normmally distributed with the mean equal to the population variance, which is theoretically determined to be $\frac{1}{\lambda^2}=\frac{1}{(0.2)^2}=25$, and standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of n. So, $sd = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}=frac{5}{\sqrt(40)}\approx 0.79$.  As be for below, the plot of the 1000 variances are plotted in a histogram with the normal curve that it should resemble plotted over the top.  

```{r}
set.seed(123)
smu<-NULL

n=40
for (i in 1:1000){
  sample = rexp(n,rate = 0.2)
  cmu<-mean(sample)
  cvar<-40/39*var(sample)
  #print(cvar)
  
  smu<-c(smu,cmu)
  svar<-c(svar,cvar)
}
var.mean = mean(svar)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
