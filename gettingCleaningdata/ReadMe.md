## Purpose:
This is a project for the 3rd course in Johns Hopkins' Data Science 
Specialization.  The projects requires for data to be gathered and tiedied 
with the following stipulations:

Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

        1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
        2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation 
           for each measurement.
        3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
        4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
        5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data 
           set with the average of each variable for each activity and each 
           subject.


## Raw data:



When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
