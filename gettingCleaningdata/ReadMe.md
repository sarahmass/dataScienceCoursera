# Getting And Cleaning Data 
This directory holds materials for the third course in the Data Science Specialization by Johns Hopkins University: Getting and Cleaning Data.

The focus of the course is to teach students about Tidy Data as referenced in [Tidy Data](http://bit.ly/2nyw5Ci). Hadley Wickham's paper on Tidy Data is required reading for the course project.

The course projects requires students to take the data collected for Anguito, et.al's paper (source listed below).  From there students are asked to collect particular variables of their datasets, recombine, label and calculate means grouped by subject activity pairs. The original data is included as well as the code and the code book required for the analysis. You check [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) for more information on the original study.
